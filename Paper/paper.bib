abstract = {Configuration design problems, characterized by the assembly of components into a final desired solution, are common in engineering design. Various theoretical approaches have been offered for solving configuration type problems, but few studies have examined the approach that humans naturally use to solve such problems. This work applies data-mining techniques to quantitatively study the processes that designers use to solve configuration design problems. The guiding goal is to extract beneficial design process heuristics that are generalizable to the entire class of problems. The extraction of these human problem-solving heuristics is automated through the application of hidden Markov models to the data from two behavioral studies. Results show that designers proceed through four procedural states in solving configuration design problems, roughly transitioning from topology design to shape and parameter design. High-performing designers are distinguished by their opportunistic tuning of parameters early in the process, enabling a more effective and nuanced search for solutions.},

@article{McComb2015,
abstract = {Designers must often create solutions to problems that exhibit dynamic characteristics. For instance, a client might modify specifications after design has commenced, or a competitor may introduce a new technology or feature. This paper presents a cognitive study that was conducted to explore the manner in which design teams respond to such situations. In the study, teams of undergraduate engineering students sought to solve a design task that was subject to two large, unexpected changes in problem formulation that were introduced during solving. High- and low-performing teams demonstrated very different approaches to solving the problem and overcoming the changes. The results indicate that there may exist a relationship between problem characteristics and fruitful solution strategies.},

@inproceedings{Michelle2012,
abstract = {complex game, requiring the students to be trained in their roles beforehand, and takes at least three hours to complete. In addition, instructors can make the game more or less challenging by changing the values of certain constraints such as the cost or by adding complexities like sudden shifts in gravity. We redesigned the Delta Design game for a sophomore-level solid mechanics course. The goals of this redesign were to emphasize the role of solid mechanics in the design process and reinforce concepts taught in the class. We also sought to make the game shorter so that it could be played in a class period and to maintain the focus on teamwork. Examples of the modifications include removing the positions that were unrelated to the course (e.g., the thermal engineer and the architect) as well as adding design constraints to the two remaining roles to keep the nature of the game complex. The redesigned game was piloted in the summer and fall of 2011 with nine students, most of whom had recently graduated from or were currently enrolled in an Introduction to Solid Mechanics course at Stanford University. In this paper, we fully describe our decision-making process to redesign the game as well as the actual design changes. We also summarize the feedback we received during the pilot games and describe our next steps in terms of further changes. Ultimately, we hope that the game can be used to increase students' engagement and conceptual understanding in learning solid mechanics, and to help students draw connections between the course material and real-world applications.},

@inproceedings{Oberoi2013,
abstract = {Over the past four years the authors have developed an online version of the Delta Design game, a board game which was developed by Bucciarelli (1) to teach students design collaboration skills. In the online version, players move tiles on a shared virtual board and communicate only through text chat. In addition, the objective functions are computed automatically each time a tile is moved, so the focus of the game changes from rapid number-crunching to negotiation. Since every state of the board, along with micro-level team performance and chat data, are captured, the resulting corpus from 38 four-player team games provides a rich resource to explore different aspects of collaborative team practices. This paper gives an overview of the online implementation of Delta Design and discusses the findings from user studies including several undergraduate capstone design classes. Observations of the board-moving tactics show that teams planning a strategy before starting the game or players sharing details about their role's constraints with other team members do not have much effect on the game's outcome. Finally, this paper demonstrates that the complex rules of the Delta Design game make it a suitable candidate for analyzing collaboration strategies in team-based design projects.},
